# My dotfiles
> Mainly used for Arch Linux, but can be used for Ubunutu/Pop as wel

Once Arch Linux is installed:
1. Pull this repo with `git clone https://github.com/joonascohen/dot.files`
2. Once finished, download packages with `sudo pacman -S <- archpkglist.txt`
3. Install oh-my-zsh and relevant plugins

# TODO
- Write a script to automate the last parts of the Arch Install
